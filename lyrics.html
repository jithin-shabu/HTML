            I had a dream
            I got everything I wanted
            Not what you'd think
            And if I'm being honest

            It might've been a nightmare
            To anyone who might care
            Thought I could fly (fly)
            So I stepped off the Golden, mm
            Nobody cried (cried, cried, cried, cried)
            Nobody even noticed
            I saw them standing right there
            Kinda thought they might care (might care, might care)

            I had a dream
            I got everything I wanted
            But when I wake up, I see
            You with me

            And you say, "As long as I'm here
            No one can hurt you
            Don't wanna lie here
            But you can learn to
            If I could change
            The way that you see yourself
            You wouldn't wonder why you hear
            They don't deserve you"

            I tried to scream
            But my head was underwater
            They called me weak
            Like I'm not just somebody's daughter

            Coulda been a nightmare
            But it felt like they were right there
            And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
            But I don't wanna let anybody know
            'Cause everybody wants something from me now
            And I don't wanna let 'em down

            I had a dream
            I got everything I wanted
            But when I wake up, I see
            You with me

            And you say, "As long as I'm here
            No one can hurt you
            Don't wanna lie here
            But you can learn to
            If I could change
            The way that you see yourself
            You wouldn't wonder why you hear
            They don't deserve you"
            
            If I knew it all then would I do it again?
            Would I do it again?
            If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
            What would they say instead?
            If I knew it all then would I do it again?
            Would I do it again?
            If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
            What would they say instead?
